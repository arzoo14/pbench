Pbench
########

A Benchmarking and Performance Analysis Framework

The code base includes three sub-systems. The first is the collection agent, ``pbench-agent``, responsible for providing commands 
for running benchmarks across one or more systems, while properly collecting the configuration data for those systems, and 
specified telemetry or data from various tools (``sar``, ``vmstat``, ``perf``, etc.).

The second sub-system is the ``pbench-server``, which is responsible for archiving result tar balls, indexing them, and unpacking 
them for display.

The third sub-system is the ``web-server`` JS and CSS files, used to display various graphs and results, and any other content 
generated by the ``pbench-agent`` during benchmark and tool post-processing steps.

The pbench Dashboard code lives in its own `repository <https://github.com/distributed-system-analysis/pbench-dashboard>`_.
